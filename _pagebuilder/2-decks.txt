=== Strategy

The following strategy relies on Arkana not having used Ectoplasmer. If he is able to use one, adjust your strategy and be very careful how many LP you have when you use Seal of the Ancients.

Special Summon Gyzarus or Essedarii as soon as possible. Be careful whether or not you attack Arkana directly. If you get him to less then 1500 LP avoid doing any additional damage to him. If you summoned Gyzarus use his effect to keep destroying any spell or trap cards. If needed attack with any Lvl 4 Gladiator Beast as long as you are mindful of Arkana's life points so that you can activate the effect to summon Gladiator Beast Bestiari and use his special effect to destroy any spell or trap cards. The trick is to get Arkana to 1500 LP or less, and leave him helpless with no spell or trap cards. 

Once you have used 1x Seal of the Ancients to destroy 1x Black Pendant or once you have destroyed 2x or 3x Black Pendants using the special effects of Gyzarus or Bestiari allow Arkana to have a monster on his side of the field. Place any Lvl 4 Gladiator Beast in defense position. Once Arkana attacks it use Burst Rebirth. At that moment you should be between 1000 and 500 LP. Finish Arkana to win the duel.

You will have to vary the strategy slightly because of the AI and what cards Arkana has in his hand. Simply make sure you have enough LP to use Seal of the Ancients or Burst Rebirth.

{{note: When using Seal of the Ancients to destroy Black Pendant you will loose 500 LP.}}
